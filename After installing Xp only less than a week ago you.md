After installing Xp only less than a week ago you can imagine my horror when the Activate Windows now prompt appeared at windows startup. Last time I used my PC I had been messing around with setting the date a couple of years back in order to register an old graphics program.   
  
I just finished installing all development software and copying all my data to new system so a reinstall of XP is not an option until I can copy my data to an external drive.  
  
Looks like I will be using Knopix to hopefully copy data to external drive and then reinstalling XP or waiting on the phone for days.
