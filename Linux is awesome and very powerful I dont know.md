Linux is awesome, and very powerful. I don't know how practical it is to recommend the average user switching to it. But those who are bashing it, either #1 haven't used it there fore they are not allowed to bash something they haven't used or #2, they have used and didn't put forth enough effort to learn it.  
  
BTW, nice job to the poster of this article.
