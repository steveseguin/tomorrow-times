Whats even better, if you use firefox instead of IE, and click on the link, firefox will launch.  
  
You can then access all what firefox can, i.e. "download" something from your desktop - a popup appears with a "show desktop" icon. Click on this icon and you have the whole of your desktop available.  
  
By the way, I do not accept that after I bought it, Microsoft wants me to "activate" something I paid for already. Does MS pay for my invested time for this needless hassle?
