HI thanks Steve. You're an answer to my prayer. Right now I am observing my CCTV server to go on functioning right after I followed the steps you taught. If this could go on forever then I am forever grateful. Windows anomaly. I just reset my processor doing my scheduled maintenance and for Christ's sake got the activation notice in 3 days not changing any hardware. Anyways thanks again.
