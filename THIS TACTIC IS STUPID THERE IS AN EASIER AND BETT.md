THIS TACTIC IS STUPID, THERE IS AN EASIER AND BETTER WAY!  
  
I know this works on Vista. If the system won;t let you log on because your key is expired, simply choose, "Activate with a new key from Microsoft".   
That will launch a web browser. Then type in c:\windows\explorer.exe and hit enter. Windows will fully load up (explorer is the shell, the interface)! You will get the task bar, desktop, everything. Just don't close the activation window, or else the system will reboot.  
  
Here is another tactic you can try once you are in Windows to get rid of the activation box without rebooting...  
I haven't tried this, but after you are into windows, go to services.ms c and TURN OFF the windows activation service. Then go to task manager and kill the activation window PID.  
  
P.S.:TUX is the man  
  
  
MS is SOO stupid. If you want to download updates from MS website, go to the validation screen. Once there, turn of Scripting and Active X controls, and pick validate windows. It will take you to the update screen where you can update you computer.  
I HONESTLY think the developers at MS let these tricks work on purpose,. I mean, NO COMPANY could be THIS stupid
