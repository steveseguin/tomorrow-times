To those of you saying BUY IT NIMROD: Nice way to assume we all want this because we are stealing windows. I am an IT Manager and I have a user that is out of the office and his LEGAL Vista expired on him. He isn't the techiest guy and is having the hardest time reactivating his Vista. This should, at least, buy him a few days until he is back in the office and I can fix this for him.  
  
Thanks.
