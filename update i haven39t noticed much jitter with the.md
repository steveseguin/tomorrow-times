update: i haven't noticed much jitter with the drive lately. the system is still feeling responsive and spiffy -- going back to a regular hard drive now feels sluggish.  
  
overall-- the kingston SSDNOW-V drives are a great value for those budget minded consumer looking for a good windows experience.
