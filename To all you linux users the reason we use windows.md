To all you linux users, the reason we use windows is because it's simple (except from when it goes wrong). What we should have done is tell Microsoft to fuck off in 95 and stick to 3.1 or 3.11. That would have solved the stability and the activation problems.  
  
On the day of the release of vista, I got a chance to use it and honestly I find it crap. It appears to have taken the worst of windows (it's good old stability!!!), the complicatedness of linux and the interface from OSX. The price is outrageous, and ontop, you have to buy office at about the same price (there go the month's wages to our good old friend BILL).  
  
Linux is pointlessly complicated and I can't see people using it much (it took me a week to install a driver when I had the instruction booklet).
