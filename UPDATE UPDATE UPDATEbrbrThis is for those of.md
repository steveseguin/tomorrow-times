UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE.  
  
This is for those of you with an expired Windows XP SP2.  
  
If you ever read the article, you may have noticed that holding down the Windows and 'U' keys together doesn't work with XP2, so it seems that you can't use the Internet Explorer trick. Don't panic, it's possible to do it, but in a different way.  
  
Yesterday night, my Windows XP SP2 expired, so I was unable to log in. There are two things that can be done:  
  
1) Reboot the computer and start Windows in safe mode with command prompt. By this time, you should have the cracks or whatever you're going to use to crack Windows available, since in in safe mode with command prompt you don't have network access, so no Internet will be available. If you need Internet access you can start with method #2 and then try safe mode again.  
  
Once in safe mode, you only see the command prompt. Type "explorer" and press Enter. Now you have desktop, taskbar, system tray and anything you like, so you can browse to a Windows Activation hack tool or whatever. If you need a crack, I've just attached one to one new email at the hotmail account novicetraveler@hotmail.com account (password zxcvbnm)  
  
2) The first thing I tried was the well-known Windows + 'U' trick, but it didn't work. I tried anything similar (Windows + 'E' and s on) but nothing worked. I was desperate, until I tried with Windows + 'U' + Ctrl + Alt + Del (5 keys, incredible). Surprinsingly enough, it worked and directly opened an Internet Explorer Window. Since Windows had booted normally, I had Internet access, which is a plus.  
  
Now comes the harder and tricky part. According to the old Windows + 'U' trick, you could just browse to 'c:\windows' and run explorer.exe to keep working on your expired Windows or open any other application. Well, this doesn't work either, since now Windows says you don't have enough permissions or something like that (my Windows is in Spanish, so I don't know the English error message). But, as always with Microsoft software, there's a workaround. If you right click on the application you want to run and choose 'Run as' you can tell Windows to run it as Administrator, entering the Aministrator's password, and voila!, the application starts without complaining about permissions of whatever.  
  
As far as I have tried, this doesn't work with explorer.exe or taskman.exe, so it seems like it doesn't work system utilities, but for me it worked with Notepad, Wordpad, WinRAR, OpenOffice and even Outlook Express and eMule. The only annoying thing is that you must know where every executable you may need is installed. Now, since you'll also have usb support, you can plug in an usb memory stick with a cracking utility and remove the activation.  
  
Try the crack I mentioned in point 1). Works like a charm
