How did an article that is unrelated to Operating System choice become a barrage of Linux fanboys touting the merits of their superior OS?  
  
I am sure that in the Linux forums, if you got a response to a Linux article or problem of:   
  
**"Well, just switch to Windows"**  
  
you would regard this as unintelligent and not adding anything to the conversation. Stop trolling if you don't have an intelligent comment.  
  
I applaud the author of this tip for pointing out a clever way to solve a problem that some Windows users may run across.
