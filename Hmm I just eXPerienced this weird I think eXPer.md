Hmm, I just eXPerienced this weird (I think) eXPerience. Let's make it short.  
  
I used my previously activated XP HOME OEM product key (about 5 months old) for a fresh installation in my new laptop. I couldn't get activated the new machine with this key, of course. So i let it as is for the whole 30 days, and just expected, the THING locked my access to the system, just this morning.  
  
And then it came to my mind, what if I try to put in a new product key, and activate it? So I googled around and found a bunch of product keys. Let's cook!  
  
I didn't need any software to change my key, because the last time I tried to activate using the old key and failed, it prompted me to enter a new product key.  
  
So I clicked YES on the "would you like to activate now" (or whatever it said, I didn't bother record it) dialog box, and expecting the same "your product key has reached the limit bla bla bla" (whatever) as I eXPerienced 30 days ago. And the result was a shock!  
  
"your product have been successfully activated" (or whatever) !!!!!  
  
And now I have two fully functional win XP home, with exactly the same product key!!! While I wrote this, I'm updating my windows (89 updates!!) without any WGA hassle.  
  
Someone tell me please how can this be possible???
