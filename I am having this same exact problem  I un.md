I am having this same exact problem!!!!!!!!! I unsecured my keyboard connection and deep-cleaned every single crevice of the keyboard in hopes that it might repair the problem. Well if I type fast enough;, it puts in random semi-colons! First it was f's, then t's, then a's. Now it's semicolons.  
  
How long did you last before throwing this LX500 against a wall? Because I'm losing my patience quickly...
