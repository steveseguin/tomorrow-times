Without reading through all 216 posts to see if this has yet to be posted, the following instructions WILL work on XP:  
  
Boot to Safe Mode, Command Prompt. Once you get there, run the following commands, taking note of the case, spacing, and punctuation:   
   
rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupOobeBnk   
   
[This must be typed exacly as above with space, caps, and comma.]   
   
Afterward, reboot. Your PC should now give you a new 30 days to activate it. This works for XP Home and Pro. I've not tried it on Vista or Windows 7.   
  
Good luck, Sam
