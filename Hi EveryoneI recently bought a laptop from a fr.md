Hi Everyone...I recently bought a laptop from a friend of a friend and my daughter accidentally deleted something so I ran a system restore. The power went out in the middle of the restore so then I had to do a repair. My hubby finished the repair for me but in doing so he did not run the setup for internet..he just skipped it..so now its asking to activate windows and I can't configure my wireless connection at all. I haven't bought a router yet and tried to connect it through my dsl but no luck..I'm new at this stuff so any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
