OK here is ALL of what you can do:  
  
Option 1: The Linux Transfer.   
  
 - THis is basically just booting of a live cd of linux and viewing your HDD that way. google "how to boot linux live cd"  
  
  
Option 2: The safe boot.  
  
 -Turn off your pc. Turn it on, and when on the boot screen (little blue bar scrolling across on XP) cut the POWER to your computer. (taking out the battery for laptops, turning of the surge-proctecter for Desktops) Now just restart and select "boot into safe mode"  
  
option 3: Mod the BIOS on startup. (i will not explain this because if you are good enough to do this, you would already know how)  
  
  
Hope this helps!
