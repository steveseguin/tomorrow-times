Well, the new iPhone 3G has been introduced and lots of details have been spilled, but there are probably lots of questions remaining. Anyone have a question that needs answering? Leave a comment with your question!  
  
I have a question myself though, that anyone who knows the answer to I would love to hear from. I currently have a 2-year voice plan with Rogers (one of two soon-to-be Canadian iPhone providers) yet no data plan. According to what information I can find, the iPhone in Canada will be selling for $ 199/299, with a new three year contract. From what I can tell from other sources, there will be no retail sales of the iPhone.  
  
So my question and issue is, if I'm already in a contract, I can't exactly get a new contract, can I? And if I can't get a new contract, how do I get the iPhone? Will I only need to get the data plan to meet the criteria? Will I end up paying 500$ minus any credit I have towards my account? Insights?
