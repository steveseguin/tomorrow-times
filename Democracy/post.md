Democracy has been imprinted in my brain as a generally positive concept. During my upbringing there was little personal experience to know just how well it was working though. While there was a sense of peace and prosperity around me that seemed to validate that it was the best system available, it takes time to see patterns emerge in such systems and to really understand their true behaviour.  

  

I'm now 37 years old with decades of experience in me and I still feel that democracy is an overall good.. I may not live long enough to have enough experience to truly claim I have answers to all, yet no one ever may. While I still have my wits though I may as well share what thoughts I do have on the topic.  

  

My first experience questioning democracy was in 2013. I was sent to a leadership course for a few days in Vancouver, and while it was a bit hokey overall, I did learn some things of value. *Don't be silent when you have something to contribute*, and also, *committees are a poor source of leadership in a company.*  

  

It happened like this. Everyone there broke out into groups for an exercise. The goal of each group was to answer a multiple choice based on the contents of a movie that we all had just watched. First as individuals we wrote down our own answers to the quiz, but when placed in groups after we had to work together to submit a group result.  

  

In my group I kept quiet mostly, letting the aggressive and loud individuals dictate what the group's answers would be. When there were more heated conflicts of opinions, our group voted to decide what the answer should be. I generally felt that avoiding conflict was a good personal strategy; I didn't want to fight for an answer and be held accountable later on if I was in fact wrong.  

  

There was no time limit for submitting our answers, except that we were locked in a room together until we were done. We went at it for an hour or two and the day after the instructor presented us all with the results.  

  

The average of each individual in our particular group was around 60%. Our group's score, based on our democratically selected answers, was higher though at around 65% accuracy. A small improvement. The average of all groups was probably closer to 70% with all groups seeing about a 15% improvement over just the average of the group's individual scores. The outcomes of all groups were fairly similar.  

  

This was all interesting as it did indeed seem to indicate that a committee-style approach to decision-making reliably improved the outcome compared to just letting a statistically average individual make the choices. The instructor used this moment though to highlight the true point of the exercise: the individual with the highest score was in fact *me*, with a score of about 87%; I also scored higher than any of the groups. It was particularly amusing to the instructor because my group had one of the lowest group scores.  

  

We were then all instructed to do another quiz, in the same groups, much the same way as before, but this time the instructor wanted us to not submit our group's answers until everyone in the group was in agreement as to what the answers should be. To make things more amusing, the quiz was based on the content of the movie, *12 Angry Men*. It is a movie that is worth watching if you haven't already.  

  

The improvement seen in the second round of group testing was shocking to me. Groups were getting closer to 85% now, versus the individual average of around 60%. No group performed worse than any of their individual score. The downside of this new approach to decision-making was that instead of coming to an agreement on the answers within an hour or so, groups were there for much longer and feeling quite exhausted by the end of it.  

  

I will say the results need to be taken with a grain of salt, as once my own group became acutely aware of just how well I performed on the first quiz, they became actively more open to relegating answers to me when unsure. I believe this attitude becomes adopted within some companies as well, like Tesla or Apple, where the leadership is seen as a proven genius, and so no one dares confront them. It took some effort on my part to ensure I felt that others in the group understood the reasons for my answers; I really did want everyone in the group to agree and not just blindly follow me.  

  

I found that the group was annoyed that I didn't speak up more in the first round of decision-making, which I was surprised by. Upsetting others was what I tried to avoid. At the end of the leadership event, my group had to fill up an actual page listing adjectives describing my negative qualities. The top adjective used was that I was too *reserved.*  

  

While I applied those lessons learned to my start-up experiences in the years following, I started to think of how it all might be applicable to nation leading and democracy. Countries can't risk failing, unlike a small start-up, so there is something to be said for predictability of outcome, even if the results are just mediocre. Countries are also very complex and vast, so having everyone come to total agreement on decisions perhaps just isn't feasible.  

  

Some companies are fortunate enough to have very strong leaders, visionaries even, but those are the exception to the rule and no leader is immortal. Committees and democracies seem to offer a less than optimal solution, but they tend to offer an above average and reliable outcome. What can improve things then?  

  

When I think about my experiences living through election outcomes over my lifetime, I see a pattern where nations that have a population that share commonality are less divisive in the polls. This is pretty obvious when stated, as commonality makes it easier to find agreement and agreement results in more agreeable election outcomes.   

  

I also see that concentrations of dissenting 
populations can create instability for democracy, regardless of 
the nation's average commonality and its overall seemingly agreeable election results. Often such splintered populations are geographical in nature, but cultural and economic identities are also examples of divisive lines.  

  

Perhaps one option then is to have different regions vote for a local representative who would then vote on behalf of the people it represents. Each region would be based on commonality, so a large city may have several representatives, representing the different faces of that city. Votes could take place in a form of tribal assembly, as it did in ancient Rome, but perhaps every vote requires 100% support to pass. While it may still prove hard to obtain 100% support, it becomes at least possible given there may be just a few dozen voters, versus millions.  

  

Why not require just a 90% approval 
on the vote instead though? It sounds appealing, but it still could leave the vote targeting a 
small population within the group. Natives, for example, could be a target by a larger colonial population   

  

Perhaps a change that could work is to ensure that group votes need only include those being affected by a vote. Majority votes are designed to force a minority into a particular action, but there is no reason to think a subset of a group can't do their own thing, especially if it does not affect others. A modern perspective on this issue would be to allow a US state to make abortion illegal, despite all other states voting to make abortion legal.  

  

One problem with the aforementioned solution is that by letting sub-groups do their own thing, it does tend to encourage a split in commonality. In the long-term, this could cause further resentment between sub-groups as their differences become ever more concrete.   

  

Perhaps another option instead would be to make democracy more fair; change the vote so that it is limited to 
the numerical population that it affects. Proportional 
representation based not on just population, but on the impact to those that the vote affects, could further what is considered fair.Â  This will still effectively turn a large nation into a subset of small nations for the 
purpose of a specific democratic decision, but such a vote could be made by majority rule and relatively more fair than existing systems. It won't be easy to perfect, 
but this solution only needs to improve the situation from where it is today to still be 
considered a success.  

  


For example, if voting to ban guns, the first aspect is to decide the impact of each person as a member of a sub-group if the vote were to pass. Everyone is affected by a gun ban, as the general population may feel they have more safety from mass killings if guns are nationally banned. It's perhaps possible to calculate the likelihood and value or that outcome for different groups and perhaps regions within the nation. You'd then consider who might be wish to buy or currently owns a gun; what is it they are giving up or forfeiting if the vote pass.
  

If
 a vote to ban gun had a sub ground with stain from the vote, and the 
vote still went through, if that subgroup is definable than it should be
 still permitted to own a gun. They may see the vote as too important to
 let a partial win for the vote to go through tho, so they may still 
vote, and perhaps with greater voting power per vote than those who do 
not own a gun.  

  

The point of a democracy in my mind is not to force your will on others, but to find the most fair and representative path forward as a unifed group.  

  

Not having common rules between states in a country can cause reduced economic flexiblity, but that does not preclude that the above wouldn't result is psoitive outcomes there still. States need to communicate, and not isolate, for that to work though.  

  

Trying to achieve that last 5% to obtain perfection can be your undoing
