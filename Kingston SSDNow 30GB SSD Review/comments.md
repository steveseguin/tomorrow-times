update: i haven't noticed much jitter with the drive lately. the system is still feeling responsive and spiffy -- going back to a regular hard drive now feels sluggish.  
  
overall-- the kingston SSDNOW-V drives are a great value for those budget minded consumer looking for a good windows experience.

no sooner did I speak my last comment than did the Kingston SSD die on me. I wish I could say it had a good run, but it lasted only half a year.  
  
This is my second, or three, solid state drives to die on me this year. The third SSD I just bought last week, so it better not die on me anytime soon.  
  
The OCZ died due to a controller issue, and hopefully this Kingston drive died of the same thing--- at least I can continue to just try different controllers (Intel?) and see what really lasts.

wow, you have very bad luck. I can see in this page that they should not fail that much (specially intel):
