Thanks for the info.  
Was looking around to see a few examples of the "real world" difference between x8/x16 since i am considering buying a p55 mobo.

great article, very informative, i was wondering if 8x made a difference. Do you have an example of 16x/4x? The 16x/8x board is about $50 more than the 16x/4x board.

IMO, 16x/4x is lesser than 8x/8x, but the different would not be dramatic with single monitor setups.  
  
I'd say 5% of performance would be lost with 16x/4x vs 16x/16x and maybe just 3% when compared to 16x/8x.  
  
Let's not forget also that many 16x/8x motherboards are still limited to 16 lanes of bandwidth; those motherboards just juggle that bandwidth better via an added switching circuit. That switching circuit could actually add an extra time delay though to the signal, which may even hurt performance more.  
  
Obviously this is something that needs more testing though to confirm; I do now have the components to do so, so maybe I will update this article in the near future.  
  
conclusion:  
Save the $50 and put it towards other aspects of your system.
