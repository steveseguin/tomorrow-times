this isn't tested on more than my computer but thanks to your help i was able to navigate to a file browser eventually and cause an error WHERE YOU CAN ACCESS THE DESKTOP AND EVERYTHING JUST AS YOUR LOGGED ON for a short period of time. taskbar and all.  
  
Because i went into the help section and tested all my internet connections their active. windows just wont let me register over the lan. so im just gonna go old school and use the modem.  
   
K first, use his procedure.  
then click help on narrator.  
in help go to options and click internet options.  
go to content tab and click certificates.  
go to import.  
Next.  
Browse.  
go up one level, and then right click my documents.  
click expand and there should be an error. :) move quickly. it will fix itself.
