What I don't understand about Microsoft is how such complicated, and I really do mean complicated multi-avenue attacks and viruses are written, almost before the new software is even on the shelf! Makes you wonder just who is writing these viruses and Trojans when you have to have an extremely intimate knowledge of the Microsoft code in order to write the attacks! Do they let just anyone have the code to play ("Beta") with and try to "Break it"...what are they really doing? In 2007 alone, Microsoft has released 5 Cumulative Security Updates and 4 Vulnerability Updates making multiple updates JUST for Internet Explorer. To those of us not privy to the code, we just wonder now, don't we? Now little Nazi Boy Jewish Hater, do not get down on me here, just yet! I am not going to tout Linux, as I have been a sys admin on the SPARC platform for Sun Solaris Servers using Sun’s proprietary Unix SunOS and BSD’s SVR4 or “System 5” since SunOS 4.1.2 (called Solaris 2 internally, or SunOS 5.x externally, for some reason!) in 1990-1991 when it was first was released. BTW: It came with support for multiprocessor - SPARCserver 600MP systems and our servers had (4) - 450mHz Processors (FAST!!!) and It also was the first CD-ROM-only release). I also took Sun Microsystems training in Sun Solaris 8 (actually SunOS 5.8 (x86)) System Admin Boot Camp and Advanced System Administration Solaris 9 (actually SunOS 5.9 – don’t believe me? Do a uname -a at cmd prompt and you will see the OS as a 5.9 for your Solaris 9 OS) Operating Environment in 2000. But alas… in 2005 Sun released the source code for Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) so it is now “Open Sourced”, JUST LIKE LINUX YOU LUMMOX (Now you can get mad you Nazi!) and you don’t have to “Guess” what holes are hidden. There are not really any, with the cavieat that it is installed correctly with ports turned off and other such natural things you do!!! All versions of Unix/Linux are potentially at risk from improper and default configurations, and Brute-force attacks against remote services such as SSH, FTP, and telnet are still the most common form of attack to compromise servers facing the Internet, Unix, Linux, MacOS OR Microsoft! But, even Brute force can be thwarted very easily with good password enforcement. Remember, It is important to remember that brute forcing passwords can be a used as a technique to compromise even a fully patched and properly configured system – Unix, Linux, MacOS or Microsoft.
