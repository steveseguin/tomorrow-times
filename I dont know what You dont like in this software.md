I don't know what You don't like in this software ... or maybe You have heard, that "greatest hackers" use Unix and Linux and You decided to rot on Microsoft. I have never see Operating system, which does not have any problems. The same matters about the software products. If everything was perfect there would not be new product versions. I can't understand people who rot on some software product ... If You don't like it don't use it or write one yourself and prove us how stable You can make it!!!
