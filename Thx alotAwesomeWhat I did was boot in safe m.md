Thx alot...Awesome.  
  
What I did was boot in safe mode. Use system restore to restore to an earlier date. This will take awhile, so pls be patient.  
  
Then after that, normal boot it to before expired and download anti wpa software. http://free.pages.at/antiwpa11/index2.php  
  
i downloaded the generic 1. Worked like a charm. Cheers
