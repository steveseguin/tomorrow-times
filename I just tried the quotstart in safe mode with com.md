I just tried the "start in safe mode with command prompt" method and typing explorer.exe in the c:\windows folder.  
  
How great to discover I was able to log into windows in safe mode, run "jellybeans keyfinder" and get the serial number that was installed. Obviously it is impossible to activate windows in safe mode so a restart was needed.  
  
The next problem at the normal login screen when I click yes I was to activate now I get a blank screen.
