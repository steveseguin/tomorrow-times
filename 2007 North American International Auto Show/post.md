A reminder to all those interested that the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit will be taking place the second week of January. It is a great chance to view upcoming cars and concepts, and quite simply it's just a lot of fun. I'm from Canada, yet I'll make time to go see it with friends. Think about it.
