I've made it to my files lol! Here's where I'm clueless though...  
  
Old laptop with original files dead - Compaq w/XP legal key  
  
New (but still old/used, however woking!) laptop was bought without hdd - Toshiba w/XP legal key.  
  
So I own 2 valid XP keys, but this activation came up when I put my Compaqs drive in the Toshiba - I assume the Toshibas hardware is causing the grief by what I've read - so now can I reactivate my hard drive to my Toshiba or do I have to reinstall XP from scratch on the hard drive while it's in the Toshiba? I can see my files in explorer via the instructions here but I cannot connect to the internet - I don't want to erase my Compaq hard drive because neither machine came with an actual XP disk, just a restore partition - so how should I reinstall and re-activate? And which key do I use? My Toshibas key or my Compaqs key?  
  
...apologies for the long ramble lol =)
