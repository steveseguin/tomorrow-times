poor.. very poor, man, this is only the half-way into it..  
  
The main-thang is.. USE (almost) fully windows on an expired pc, with taskbar, with start-up-button, with your common desktop, BUT WITHOUT TASKMANAGER (but I bet theres also a way to keep it runnin).  
  
So, finally, in this case yoouu WILL need something else (a file of course) which will prevent windows-security-checkup-something to log you out if you once logged in with this trick.  
  
So that file you need, you could create on a pc which should have almost the same hardware like your pc where you want to use that file for your expired windows.. but in the even best case you did this as a wise man, if you ever had successfully activated your windows once!)  
  
That Files name is: "wpa.dbl" and maybe your friend has a working windows which is already activated, get a try to use that that file (which could be found in x:\windows\system32-folder) and use it on your own system-folder.  
  
OF COURSE, you can try my trick without that succesfully-activated-windows-wpa.dbl (from another pc which is almost with the same hardware-setup like yours, or a wpa.dbl-stored-file) but then you ve got maybe 2 minutes until your system will drop you out..  
  
So if you are finally in that iexplorer-window and once you got your wpa-file you chose over your browser that location of that successfully-activated "wpa.dbl"-file (maybe from an usb-stick) and copy it right into your windows\sytem32-folder, and of course overwright that existing bitch-file xD  
  
So if you already had done that.. you are able to get your Windows-Desktop and your Taskbar back, finally .. that good old Windows look that you are known from before your pc "expired" xD  
  
So go to your browser and open that directory "c:\windows\system32 (or wherever you installed it)" and search for that file cmd.exe (you know.. that important little file) xD  
  
if that dos-shell comes up, type in it :"explorer.exe" of course, thats all  
  
your windows is almost recovered in that you already known before that hackmack. BUT still dont close that "windows-activation-window" minimize that.. and if you dont have a proper wpa.dbl-file I bet you get kicked some minutes later.  
  
But if you have that file, and windows is a bitch, you may have to set it up sooner than you would think. then it could rescue your work on your pc..  
  
Whatever.. have a try!
