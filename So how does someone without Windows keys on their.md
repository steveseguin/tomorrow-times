So, how does someone without Windows keys on their keyboard (being a curmudgeon, I use IBM Model M clicker keyboards) do this?  
  
One other note: While the Task Bar may not be available, if the system is booted up far enough to run Task Manager (using Ctrl+Alt+Del), there should be a File...Run command option available from the Task Manager. You could run Explorer.exe or other commands from there.
