So I did receive my Thinkpad T400 in the mail about a week ago now; I ordered it on the 24th of November and had it delivered by the first week of December. Overall, the delivery times were good and Lenovo did not make we wait in queue when I called them about a tracking number. My order spent nearly a week in customs though, which is not really a fault Lenovo can be blamed for. Overall, my experience was acceptable and I would order from them again.  
  
Finishing off my last post, the bluetooth Laser mouse I gave a preview of previously works fine with the notebook. With the press of a button, it only took a few seconds for the T400 to detect it and have it start working. It does work on carpet, although the carpet moves with the mouse, which causes it not to be very accurate. The mouse goes into sleep mode after a while, which takes a couple seconds to come out of when moved, but it hasnt annoyed me yet. It works like a mouse; 800 dpi I think, and the mouse/bluetooth works out-of-the-box with MacOSx86. No problems.  
  
Now, I did mention MacOSx86. Well, I was curious to see if the ThinkPad t400 was compatible with iATKOS 10.5.5--- it is not, at least not OOTB. The keyboard/trackpad/trackpoint do not function, although drivers are available that can make this work apparently. It requires a USB keyboard and mouse (usb/bluetooth) to even get into the OS, so make sure you have them near by. The Intel 5300 wireless (what my T400 has) is not compatible, nor is the Intel 4500 GMA graphics. You can replace the Wifi card and you can get the dedicated ATI 3470 graphics version of the T400, which would overcome those problems. The battery life with the MacOS operating system sucks; the system runs at full, resulting in a very short battery life, even with the 9-cell battery. The sound does not work OOTB. Generally speaking, the T400 is not the best Hackintosh, but it can be made to work. IMO, buy a macbook instead if you want MacOS.  
  
Well, after my failed attempt with MacOSx86, I tried to get back into Windows. Well, the MacOS screwed up my partition tables. Since the Thinkpad T400 comes with 3 partitions, and now they were damaged, my computer did not know where to boot from and hence, didnt boot. The Lenovo t400 did not come with a repair disc. Instead, the repair/recovery software was installed into one of the partitions, the backup data was installed in another, and then winOS was installed on the last. Since I couldnt boot into the repair software, I was fucked.  
  
 Lenovo expects you to burn a repair/backup disc when you get the notebook, but since I got the CDRW/DVD-ROM drive, it would have taken 12 CDs to make the backup.-- so i didnt. Now, i was wishing i had. To fix the partition tables, I downloaded a windows vista repair cd off the internet from another computer and used it to fix my partition problem. But this caused a whole new problem. When windows booted, it booted with the wrong drive letter, whiched caused Vista to not function properly. My recovery partition was also no longer available as a boot option. I was able to fix the drive letter problem, but I still lost the function of the repair/recovery partition.  
  
Lenovo does include A LOT of repair/recovery/backup software; unfortunately none of it worked when I needed it. It was partially my fault I guess, but it would have been nice to have a recovery CD included also. Part of the reason why I did not just format the drive and install a fresh copy of Vista was because I did not want to lose the software/drivers that came with the notebook.
