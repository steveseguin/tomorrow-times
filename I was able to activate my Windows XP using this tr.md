I was able to activate my Windows XP using this trick.  
  
I used File - Open in Internet Explorer.  
  
Booted up my domain controller, made a public share with a WPA Crack in it and then browsed to it on the to-be-activated Windows XP machine. Then I ran it and it worked perfectly.  
  
Thanks for finding this out!
