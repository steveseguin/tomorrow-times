Hoping to at least spur some ideas for you, here is a break down of some of the items I have noticed my female friends have bought themselves this year. Generally, most of these gifts are going to set you back a couple hundred dollars, or more, but any mother should be well worth that.

  


**Vitamix 5200** - an uber kitcher blender that can turn pretty much anything into an ultra fine smoothie.  

  


**Nike FuelBan**d - a daily calorie counter and activity monitor. While pedometers exist, this wristband is quite stylish and has a built in accelerometer that allows you to analyze your movements though out the day.  

  


**Nest Self-learning 2nd Gen Thermostat** - Honeywell has one, too  

  


**Keurig Coffee Maker** - check Amazon.com for a list of good substitutes  

  


**iPad Mini** - If they don't already have a tablet, this is one of the current favorites.  

  


**Bose QuietComfort 15** - noise-cancelling headphones, while better headphones exist, sometimes the trendy items have the most appeal.

  


If all else fails, Amazon.com has a list of great gift ideas. Quite a few nice gifts for $20 even, such as a USB charging in-wallÂ receptacle.  

  

If you have your own great idea not mentioned here though, please add it to the comments! We'd all love to hear it.

  


Best of luck!
