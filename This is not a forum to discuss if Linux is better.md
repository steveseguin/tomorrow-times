This is not a forum to discuss if Linux is better than Windows, it is to help those with an expired Windows password. Great info from Steve, I learned a few things from you. You may have to start in safe mode or Steve’s suggestion may work  
a) Magical Jelly Bean Version 1.41 allows you to change the windows key  
b) Windows XP Product Activation Hack! WinXP.Activation.V1.1English.rar (661 KB). You will asked to insert a Windows XP disk to copy the required files from.  
c) Interesting article about window keys and how to manipulate them. http://www.experts-exchange.com/OS/Miscellaneous/Q\_21851820.html  
 OK, since I live inside a volcano on top of a mountain in a third world country and can’t post attachments what I have decided to do is to e-mail these programs to a bogus Hotmail account which you can then access / forward / copy or save the programs from. The account is novicetraveler@hotmail.com and the password is zxcvbnm.  
 The text file contains several thousand somewhat legitimate XP SP2 serials / keys, try to use the one of these serials in conjunction with the magical jelly bean finder.  
 If you found my input useful let me know, I’m trying to sort out a friends computer half way around the world.  
 Now there’s some USEFUL info, unlike “change to Linux” - Bahhhhhh
