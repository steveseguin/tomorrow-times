ok - so i get to know say why most of those artists do not deserve the title groundbreaking?

lol. not my call really, i just cut and pasted the list from edge102. they called those songs 'groundbreaking'. :S feel free to . uh. share your own opinion on what would be better.

Sorry, but all of these whiny, emo, neo-teeny-bopper-punk bands suck.

yes. yes they are and yes you are right. i was just low on topic ideas.
