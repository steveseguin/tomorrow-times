    The upcoming Telsa Truck I'd guess is polygon shaped because of the cold-rolled steel used: cheap, flat, yet hard. I think the truck's design as a result was a solution to the problem, *how can Tesla use SpaceX's new steel sheets to make a car*.  
  
I personally would have preferred forged (50KT?) metal, as it allows for exotic shapes and strength, but that would have increased the cost quite a bit I assume. Forged titanium is what was used in the F-22 Raptor stealth jet fighter, for example; sexy stuff. Why not impress the world with a 100KT isostatic press though, Elon? #missedOpportunity.  
  
Either way, despite being able to withstand a sledge hammer, paint still scratches, steel can rust, and cars need to crumple if hit to absorb the shock. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumple_zone>

   If you make a truck that is bigger and heavier than the next guy, what you made is a tank that will kill whoever is inside any economy car that it hits. However big you make it though, a concrete pillar will still win and parking spaces aren't getting any bigger.  
  
   Further to the safety concerns, car windows that can't be shattered and doors that can't be pried open leave rescuers unable to help you in a crash. If the truck falls into a lake, perhaps the windows can't be shattered like a normal truck to help you escape; you better hope the computer works to auto-open the windows before it short circuits, else you drown. <https://mythresults.com/episode72>  
  
  
   As per this podcast episode, sometimes added safety features can be worse than what they intend to prevent. <https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/cautionary-tales/>  

  

Bold and different is fun. Either way, Thank's Elon and the SpaceX/Tesla team for making my world a bit more surreal. -steve
