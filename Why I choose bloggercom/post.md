Ive decided to start this non-personal blog, as a personal project, with no thoughts of getting rich off it. I have other blogs, personal and business, none yet on blogger though. I've decided to use Blogger.com this time around, as hosts such as myspace or livejournal do not offer the professionalism or advanced developer controls I would want for this blog. Other blogging software or places, such as Wordpress, I do and have used in the past, but I wanted a service that would be easier for me to use, free to use and have hosted for me, be part of some social community, while yet still letting me export my site or database away from blogger.com if I ever decided to expand to more than what they offer me.
