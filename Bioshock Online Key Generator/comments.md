This doesn't generate ACCEPTABLE keys.......... not even VALID ones, LOL!  
  
You gotta improve it :P  
  
Use the FoB's keygen :P

We are working in a keygen already. This is not following the discovered rules we found in working serials, but, nice work the first two houses got right in many serials ;)  
  
u should probably keep trying maybe yours gets better than ours :)  
  
Cheers!

im working on it. stealing your code, moddying it. porting it. etc. javascript is a little less likely to infect a computer than an exe. ;)
