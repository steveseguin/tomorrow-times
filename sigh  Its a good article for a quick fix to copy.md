sigh. Its a good article for a quick fix to copy files. I agree with your reasoning of allowing people to get their files after not activating, however, this would generally only be people that pirated the software and can not activate, stuff them. and of course, why is it linux users have nothing better to do than promote it duirng windows conversations/articles. Also where does the 'linnux' pronunciation from from, wasnt it named after Linus Torvalds? not Linnus. and before anyway says it pronounced like it ends in unix, no, no its not. If that was how it was meant, that is how it would be spelled.
