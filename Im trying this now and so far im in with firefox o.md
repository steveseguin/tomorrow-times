Im trying this now and so far im in with firefox open, but thats not really that much use if i want to copy all my files to disks.  
  
But heres a few tips ive found, open an image in your browser or select some text, right click and click send to, or something similar, this gets you into outlook express and word if you have these, from here you can get into VB, i also found if you browse the pictures from say clipart, you can right click and click explore on things like my documents, this also fully restores the system, however it logs you out after about a minute.  
  
So heres the ultimate solution for getting past this.  
  
Boot your pc, twat F8 or del on some pcs, whatever your key is to get into the BIOS, then set the date back.  
  
BOOYAH! Ive used this method for about a year, works like a charm, until now and its finally caught up with me.  
  
Now its just a case of finding the right date again, or hacking my way in the system.  
  
Fun.
