The original solution did not work for me (German XPSP2). But a slightly different approach worked. Minimize the activation window then press STRG N - and an Internet Explorer window opens. You can now enter c:/ (or whatever) and access, move and copy all your files.  
  
What does not work is to run any programs, not even CMD, you get an error message about not enough quota.  
  
But usually it is more practical to boot from a CD (Linux or WindowsPE).
