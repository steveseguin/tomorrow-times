The version of the software that is capable of doing this sinfully pleasurable act is currently [free to the public to download](http://forum.parallels.com/thread5997.html) and use, as the software is currently only in the beta stages of development. If you have an Intel Mac, amaze your friends and family this holiday season by being first to show them this new bit of computer magic in action.
