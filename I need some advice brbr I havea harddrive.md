I need some advice.....   
  
 I havea harddrive and installed Windows xp home edtition on it... and the grace period ran out is there any way I can get a activation code off the net or skip it?...or do I have to call Microsoft?  
  
It's not hooked up to the net...and I might not even put it on the net period.
