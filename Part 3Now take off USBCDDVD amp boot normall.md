Part 3:  
Now take off USB/CD/DVD & boot normally. Get into windows activation and leave the machine (no touching keyboard or mouse or mving for screensaver to work) for 20 to 40 minutes. The command box pops up as screensaver! type: C:\windows\explorer.exe  
If this does not happen try again without logging into activation by saying No to the dialog box or leave it and it will eventually work after 30 minutes of not touching the machine.  
  
- Once I had the explorer, I ran AntiWPA and then WPA\_KILL to make double sure! Then shut down & rebooted into DOS/win98. Deleted the svchost (which was in fact explorer.ex) and restored svchost:  
ren svchost.bak svchost.exe in windows\system32  
Shut down and took off USB (or your CD/DVD) and booted normally.  
It takes a while to boot in again as the thief's software is confused! CTRL+ALT+Del gives you the task manager. In processes kill unnecessary stuff like wuaudit or similar but nothing else if you are not sure. Also from Task Manager file menu choose 1st option to run & type explorer.exe if things are taking too long.  
  
Use AntiWPA or WPA\_KILL or other stuff again if you want. Copy your stuff from desktop to safety and upgrade to Windows 7 (torrents) in good time which has a great deactivator there too. Set updates to NO as in XP. If new Service Pack for win7 comes up for Windows 7, don't use or at least wait 6 months to a year before installing as it will only do this sort of stuff again.  
  
Good luck.  
love & peace out ;)
