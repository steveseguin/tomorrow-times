Personally I use both Linux AND Windows. I'm weird like that.  
  
Anyway, my advice (if you just want to get to your files and nothing more) is to get a hold of one of the Linux Live CDs (e.g. Ubuntu, Knoppix) and use it to copy the files you want to another drive (e.g. an external drive). There are websites all over detailing how to do this. Just do a Google Search.
