My machine had been off for a couple months, and while it was off, it had expired before I got it activated. It also had a static IP address from another system, so could not connect to the internet. I got into Explorer using your trick, then managed to get Explorer running through that. Once I had Explorer up, I got into control panel (within that few seconds it runs is plenty of time) and got into my Network Settings and was able to reset the static IP address to DHCP, got a new valid address and was able to activate successfully. THANKS!
