Thank you so much! I have literally been bawling my eyes out for the past 4 hours because I couldn't get into my computer and get my paper, which is due tomorrow! I just bought my comp used and this was my first time using XP- and I didn't know what the activation thing was so I just kept Xing out of it. Until it expired yesterday and I couldnt get into my computer! But when I tried to activate it, it said I don't have a valid product. I tried talking to them on the phone and told them what happened and that I bought it used but they just said basically too bad. I'm a broke college student too and there's no way I'm shelling out the cash for another XP disk!! Thanks for the life-saving trick!
