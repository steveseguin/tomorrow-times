See the absolute saddest part of this ALL is that Microsoft will probably have a hotfix for this exact "bypass" procedure.   
  
Not to mention, they won't allow you to access your own personal files. This comes into play as a privacy concern for me. AS it is NOT Microsoft's responsibility nor right to hold my files for randsom.   
  
EULA OR NOT! It's extortion.
