Hey guys. This article seems really handy.   
Its just im in a bot of a bind. Im using an IBM T40, which doesn't have a Windows key - meaning I can't use the combination Win + U for Narrator.  
  
Are there any other ways of bringing up applications when windows is in this state?  
  
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
