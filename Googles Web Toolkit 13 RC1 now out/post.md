As a hobbyist web developer, I know just how frustrating it can be to design a website with really neat functionality and layout. I have been really amazed at how Google creates their many websites, having them all lack that rudimentary feel most older websites today have. Google has really gone above and beyond by releasing the same tools to the public, for free, that they have used to make their very own websites. To top it off, they even have now released the source code for this Web Toolkit of theirs. The toolkit simplifies the programming process by converting easy-to-write Java code into the painfully tricky to perfect AJAX stylings.  
  
What does this mean to anyone who doesn't speak Geek? Well, expect fancier, more powerful, and more intuitive websites to start showing up on Internet that don't have multimillion dollar developer teams working for them.  
  
I love you Google. Please don't ever turn evil.
