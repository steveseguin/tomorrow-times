It seems both [indie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_(music)) and [emo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo_(music) music are still going strong lately in this genre.  
  
  
For those not into the new rock scene, the new Gwen Stefani album, Wind It Up, is freshly out and already climbing the charts. It has a bit of a fun weird candy pop taste to it that I'm not quite sure I understand. I can only imagine this album being this successful due to Gwen Stefani's super star popularity and a lack of important vitamins in the diets of kids today.
