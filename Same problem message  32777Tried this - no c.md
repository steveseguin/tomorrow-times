Same problem (message # 32777).  
  
Tried this - no change.  
  
Problem was date & time out by a large amount.  
  
Could have fixed in BiOS but seeing as I was already in IE I browsed to c:\windows\system32  
  
Then ran the cmd file  
  
Typed in date in dos box and then entered correct date  
Typed in time in dos box and then entered correct time  
  
Leaving cmd window open I then retried and it allowed me to proceed with the activation.
