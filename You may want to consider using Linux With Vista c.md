You may want to consider using Linux. With Vista coming, Microsoft wanting another $140, and them becoming much more strict on upgrades (change out hardware and you have to buy a new copy of Vista!), I've decided not to put up with that tyrrany. I can do everything I need so far in Linux except Quicken and games.
