Using VMlite, it was a small challenge for a Dell OEM image. I used this method with the narrator to get to my dropbox account where I had a copy of Wpakill. It was zipped so I downloaded it. Then went into safe mode with command prompt and launched explorer.exe. Uninstalled the antivirus that kept gobbling up the wpakill.dll's. unzipped, Launched the wpakill batch file. Rebooted, rebooted again to clear up errors. All is working.
