I'm trying to use parallels transporter to copy my old pc onto my new mac and it worked fine until... when i went to log in it says i need to activate, so i say yes, the desktop background appears and then the activate window shows up with a picture of keys and then nothing at all, nothing to click or type and if you close it it logs you out, so  
  
but i figured out another way in thought i'd share:  
  
shut down, restart, hit F5 to get the boot menu, then F8 for boot options, choose safemode with command prompt,  
  
 it will start a cmd prompt, you can't type explorer.exe here, but if you ctrl alt del you get the task mgr then in the file menu choose run and type explorer.exe and you're into the computer in safe mode and can access files etc...  
  
my issue is that you can't activate windows while in safemode, and i can't get into the activation screen the normal way, so i'm still screwed but for those of you trying to get into the machine to salvage your files what i did works
