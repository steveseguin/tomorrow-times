Instead of letting Youtube host content for the TV networks, leaving YouTube to rake in the advertising dollars, the TV networks are considering hosting their own content online, keeping the profits for themselves.   
Ars Technica's article continues off by arguing why such an attempt may fail, stating users may not like the potential heavy censoring by the TV networks, the overly flashy graphics that may overtake functionality, and the difficulty in overthrowing YouTube's already established dominance. Regardless, don't be surprised to see more competition for YouTube in the coming new year.
