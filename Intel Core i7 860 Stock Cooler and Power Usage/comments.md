After doing some stress testing with my new i7/860, and stock Intel heatsink & fan, I also am a bit concerned about the stock cooling. After running Prime 95 on 4 cores/8 threads for about 10 minutes, I'm at 80 degrees C core temp. And this is in a room that is 68 degrees F; in summertime this room will be 15 F/8 C hotter.  
  
This is at spec CPU speed, not overclocked.

Experiencing such problems right now, got 35-45 in ilde and going into 90+ after 2 minutes running prime95. Going to undervolt a bit, and to find a better heat-sink.  
  
thx for tip (undervolting).
