Here's a fascinating montage of 1993 AT&T ads predicting a technological future. 

  
  
It's really interesting how their vision of the future included so many things that actually did come to pass. Except AT&T brought us none of them. 

Its also amusing that they overlooked the fact that phonebooths have since been replaced by cell phones.

Here at The Tomorrow Times we will explore such predictions of the future too, whether they are days or years away.
