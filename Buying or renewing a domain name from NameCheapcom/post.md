If you are buying domain names from Namecheap, a 20%-off coupon code that has long worked for me on most purchases is:# **COUPONFCNC**

Other tips:  
* If buying a new .COM domain, and you're able to score a good deal, sometimes it's a good idea to buy several years on the domain up front. You won't get a good deal on a renewals usually, so do the math before buying.
* If you are willing to do some extra work, transferring domains between registrars can snag you some pretty sweet discounts with coupons that only work for transfers. There's often at least one sale a year where transfers are especially well priced.
