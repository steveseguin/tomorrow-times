I never liked the fact Pepsi used corn-based fructose sugar in its cola and aspartame in its diet cola. I felt my only options were diabetes or brain cancer. Well, now we all may soon have a new alternative -- Pepsi RAW.   
  
What makes this interesting to me is the truly all natural ingredients and choice to go back to the days of sugar cane being used as a sweetner. Better tasting? Fewer calories? Awesome! Despite the fact it will surely cost a lot more and be hard to come across, it could start a 'healthly alternative war' in the soda industry. Something we could all benefit from and it's LONG overdue, if you ask me.
