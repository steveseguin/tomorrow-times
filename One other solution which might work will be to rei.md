One other solution which might work will be to reinstall windows using the repair option which comes up after the End User Agreement screen. If you do not have a Win XP SP2 disk, borrow one and use one of the 3000 plus almost legitimate serials that I left as an attachment on the bogus novicetraveler@hotmail.com account (password zxcvbnm). To reinstall windows, start the computer and you will be given an option to boot from CD by pressing any key. If this message does not come up you need to enter setup (F2 on some computers, DEL on others and F10 on Compaq) and set the boot sequence so it boots from the CD first. Once you boot from the CD it is straight forward, ignore the Repair Console option and choose the Repair Option that comes up after end user Agreement. If you get a screen that talks about file systems FAT - NTFS do not go ant farther, BAIL!!!   
Once Windows has reinstalled you will be given the option to Turn Off Automatic Updates, TURN THEM OFF!!! You will be asked if you want to register â€“ answer NO!!!  
Good Luck
