At the moment I'm using this narrator thing to access a web browser.  
  
I use the open file option and go to my cddrive, right click it and hit open then it gives me an error message which in returns gives me a few seconds of desktop.  
  
My situation goes like this, I use a dell dimensions 8200 from 02, replaced the HD a month ago and didn't have the OS disks anymore. So I used a Emachines backup OS disc someone in my house had. Install went fine, yet I still got the 30 day activation period thing and when I went to try to activate it never worked.  
  
So I tried that registry fix a few days before it expired which just got rid of the counter and didn't do anything overall. I'm still technically locked out of windows, with the exception of the work around I mentioned. Though now when I go to hit "yes" on activate now...I get the pop up that says windows is already activated yet when I hit ok it brings me to the log in screen.  
  
My questions are..  
  
1. is there a way to delete, remove, disable the activation process overall.  
  
2.Is it true I can't reinstall a OS on this after I used an Emachines backup OS disc?  
  
Any help would rule, I don't mind doing things through the narrator but it's annoying.  
  
halp plz.
