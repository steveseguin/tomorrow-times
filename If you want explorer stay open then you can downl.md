If you want explorer stay open, then you can download a free os called ReactOS, If you then Run the OS off a CD or Memory stick and Copy the file "explorer\_new" from C:\ReactOS and Copy it to C:\Windows along with "notyfyhook.dll" from C:\ReactOS\System32 into C:\windows\System32, you can run this instead of explorer.exe and it will not close, BUT it's not completely the same as windows and is experimental, but if you're desperate, it's out there. (Or download Windows 8 :))
